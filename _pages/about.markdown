The engineer in me loves to solve problems, whatever they are. Mechanical engineering design, mechatronics, robot autonomy, machine learning, you name it, and I'll solve it. 

You can download my complete CV <a href="/assets/files_cv/complete_resume.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>, or a simplified version of it <a href="/assets/files_cv/simple_resume.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.

If you have project ideas to discuss or just want to connect, feel free to contact me and and I'll get back to you as soon as possible!

I also provide tutoring services for high-school level math and physics, and university level calculus, probability and statistics, dynamics, and statistics.
