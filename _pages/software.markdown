	The software projects below were mostly completed during my PhD. Anything related to swarms is from the research I completed at the <a href="https://cimlab.mie.utoronto.ca/" target="_blank">Computer Integrated Manufacturing Lab</a> and the <a href="http://asblab.mie.utoronto.ca/" target="_blank">Autonomous Systems and Biomechatronics Lab</a>, both at the University of Toronto.

	(1) Collaborative-Motion Control Strategies for Robotic Swarms
</a>
<p>
	In this project, I worked on the development of motion control strategies for robotic swarms that rely on collaborating with each other to compensate for their individual sensing limitations.

	(2) Constrained Swarm Motion Planning
</a>
<p>
	Collaborative-motion control strategies impose constraints on the motion of the swarm. In this project, I developed a motion planning methodology that considers these constraints while optimizing a motion execution performance index.
