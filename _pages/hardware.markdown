A good engineer knows hardware better than software. That's because hardware can work without software, but software is nothing without hardware! 

Below are some of the fun hardware projects I've worked on in the past. Though, I admit, none of them would work without software.

(2) Design of a Slip-Angle Sensor for the University of Toronto Formula Racing Team
</a>
<p>
	A vehicle's slip-angle plays an important role in the perfomance of its dynamics. In this project, I worked with a team of engineers on the development of a slip-angle sensor for the University of Toronto Formula Racing Team.
