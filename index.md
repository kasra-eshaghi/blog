Thanks for stopping by.
Iâ€™m Kasra, a mechanical engineer, a roboticist, and an adventurer. My research background is in the development of collaborative-motion control and planning methodologies for robotic swarms with sensing limitations, with a side of hardware development. 

During the day, I like to think about the world's most complex problems that can be solved through automation. At night, I dream about the mountains I want to climb, the lakes I want to paddle, and the books I want to read.

I'm on the lookout for a job that lets me turn my dreams into reality. Let's connect and make a meaningful impact together!
